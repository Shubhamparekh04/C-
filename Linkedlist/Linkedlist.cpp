//Linked List :

it's a linear Datastructure where elements are stored in dynamic memory(heap) in a non-contiguas manner

1.Every element is known as NODE
2. NODE has 2 parts one containes DATA & anotherpart Contains REFERENCE(POINTER) of next element.
3. last NODE containes NULL in 2nd part(REFERENCE).

//Advantages:
1. Efficient for situation where the data size is unkown beforehead or can change frequently

2. Easy to insert delete nodes compared to array in start-middle-end of list

3. No need of contegeous(in liner format one to second second to third only.... )  memoryblock

//Disadvantags:

1. Random Access : accessing specific node by index is slower than array as it requires traversing the list from the beginning

2. Memory overhead: Each node stores an extra pointer, leading slightly higher memory usage compared to array.



// Type of Linkedlist:

1. Singly (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singly-linked-list-definition-meaning-dsa/)
2. Doubly (https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240809123741/Insertion-at-the-End-in-Doubly-Linked-List-copy.webp)
3. Circular (https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240806130914/Representation-of-circular-linked-list.webp)
4. Doubly circular (https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20220830114920/doubly-660x177.jpg)


Operations on Linkedlist:

1. Insertion
2. Deletinn
3. Traversal
4. Searching
